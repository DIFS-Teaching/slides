# Table layout

  - Misusing tables for defining a layout
  - Historically the only solution, now not used anymore
  - Advantages 
    - Simple design
    - Compatibility
    - Many options in content manipulation, alignment, ...

    - Page layout is defined directly in HTML
    - Long and obscure code (`<tr><td><tr><td>`)
    - The table is displayed after being read completely (slow)
