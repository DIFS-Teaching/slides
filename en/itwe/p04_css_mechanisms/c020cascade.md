# Cascade of Rules

* For every *HTML element*, the browser takes **all CSS rules** whose selector matches the element.
    - Each rule defines the values of some CSS properties.
* The rules are *ordered* to a *cascade*.
* The *cascaded values* are used for computing the final visual properties of the element.

**Ordering criteria:**

<div>

1. Rule origin 
    * Author rules override the user agent styles.
2. **Rule selector specificity**
    * The more specific is the selector, the more important is the value
3. Order of specification 
    * If the rule has **equal origin and specificity**, the _latest_ specified value is used.

</div>

# Rule specificity

- Specificity is a number `abcd`, where 
    - `a=1` in case of inline style, `a=0` otherwise
    - `b` is the number of `id` attributes in selector
    - `c` is the number of classes in selector
    - `d` is the number of element names in selector
- Shortly:
    * `id` > `class` > `element`

```css
#main p.intro span { ... } /* 0 - 1 - 1 - 2 ~ 112 */
p.intro span { ... } /* 0 - 0 - 1 - 2 ~ 12 */
p span { ... } /* 0 - 0 - 0 - 2 ~ 2 */
```
