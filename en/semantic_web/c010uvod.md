# Semantic Web

- A vision of *web of data* (as opposed to the *web of documents*)
	- Publishing machine-readable (or machine-understandable) data
- Basic concepts:
	- Knowledge representation -- Resource description framework (RDF)
	- Shared conceptualization -- ontologies
	- Agents -- service producers and consumers

- Integration with the existing web
	- Annotation in web pages
	- Somewhat slow, but improving
